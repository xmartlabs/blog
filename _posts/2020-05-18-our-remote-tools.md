Covid-19 pandemic has affected everyone. All countries are taking measures to stop the spread and adopting some form of lockdowns, some are more restrictive than others.


People were forced to work from their homes. But this could be something complex or impossible, especially in areas like tourism, sports, entertainment, retail and many others.


There is no doubt that the crisis impacts all industries. It's also true that some industries will overcome the crisis stronger than ever, this is the case of a business that uses the internet as its main distribution channel, Netflix, Amazon, Uber Eats, zoom are just some examples. The education industry will also change drastically, especially in those that provide online courses, which has a huge potential to scale.


There will also be a change in people and business behavior as a result. We are more willing to meet virtually and companies were forced to collaborate remotely. In this sense those companies that had already been collaborating with clients distributed around the globe have a lot of opportunities to grow since every person and organization quickly adopts some technology to communicate and collaborate efficiently from anywhere.


There will be many organizations opening remote job positions and contracting digital product studios like Xmartlabs for the first time. This willingness to work remotely would have taken years in a normal scenario instead of just 3/4 months. Please, don't get me wrong, I'm not saying the COVID effects are good, I'm just saying there will be changes on how persons lives and companies work. In fact, the best talent and services are globalized and not having location restriction is something good for those that can take advantage of it.

# Our toolset

Let's move on to how we handle the pandemic and which toolset helps us stay connected and productive.

Since our very beginning, at Xmartlabs, as a digital product development studio, we've been collaborating remotely with our clients due to geographic limitations, we basically offer high qualified skills in every technical aspect of a digital product, from a CTO alike strategy and innovative vision, agile project managers, UX specialist and designers to machine learning, augmented reality specialist. Flexibility in team composition and agility in roadmap along with frequent releases/delivery is crucial for our clients which seeks a disruptive innovation through technology. We have a long way running distributed teams not only collaborating with our clients but also among Xmartlabs team members since each one at Xmartlabs has the freedom to work from home if needed.

Before I dip into the tools let's me enumerate some of the benefits of working and collaborate remotely.

* It Will be easier to hire talent all over the world.
* It Will be easier to expand business presence in other markets.
* Having the team in different time zones we eventually can provide 24/7 services.
* Gain cultural insights and different perspectives.
* Companies all over the world will feel comfortable collaborating remotely and more willing to work with us.

### Time tracking tool

#### Toggl

A time tracking tool for teams. By using it we accurately track how long it takes to get a task done. It also provides some cool reports when we can see profits against time spent and we can see which project /client is more profitable.

### Project management tools

#### Trello

Trello helps us with tasks management. It's simple, like a board indicating what has to be done, what's in progress and what's done. We can easily visualize what needs to get done and aggregate feedback and comments.

#### Jira

A project management tool for software teams that follow an agile approach. Task and release planning, releases and reports are just few of the functionalities provided by Jira. It takes more time to set up it so it's recommendable for ongoing or long term software projects.

### Communication Tools

#### Slack

Slack is one of the most widely used tools by remote teams where team members can get instant feedback and connect with their colleagues, both one-on-one and in groups. It organizes conversations into channels where team members can join and leave. It also provides conversation threads that make it easier to follow a conversation and also have more than one conversation on the same channel.
One feature that stands out is the ability to install apps that automatically report on business activity, like new pull request to GitHub, newly deployed app version, and any kind of bots that help keep teams engaged.

#### Discord

We onboard on Discord just a few months ago. Discord provides communication channels/rooms like Slack but its strengths are different. It provides one of the best room voice communication and we can easily communicate using voice with different teams or feel like we were in the same room. It's super easier to communicate via voice in a room without a previous arrangement.

#### Zoom

It's a video conferencing app. We use it mainly for our team informal hangouts. One fun feature is the gallery view, which allows you to view everyone on the video conference at once and makes it feel, for a moment, like our remote team is close together!"

#### Google Hangouts

It's a video conferencing app we normally use to work and communicate with our clients, it's well integrated with G suite apps.

### Document collaboration tools

#### Google Drive

Google drive is a well-known set of tools to edit and collaborate over basic documents like text files, spreadsheets, presentations, etc. It's like Microsoft Office in the cloud that works perfectly for remote teams. It also provides cloud storage apart of document collaboration tools.

#### Notion

We mainly use notion as our company's long term memory and playbook. Every documentation, guide, training and process of the company is added in a particular notion section so it's easy to keep everything accessible and well organized.

### Code hosting and code collaboration

#### Github
If an engineer had to choose one developer tool, probably this would be GitHub. It's not just git in the cloud, it provides us with a full range of collaborative tools and integrations. We not only host our code in GitHub but we also review it and it allows us to collaborate in order to produce high-quality software products.

&nbsp;

We still have many other remote collaborative tools to enumerate but these are used by all the team.
You may think, this is a huge amount of tools but each one serves in different purposes and all together allows us to easily collaborate and be more productive.


I hope it helps you to choose the right tools that maximize your team productivity!!
