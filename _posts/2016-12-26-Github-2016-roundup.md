A new year just arrived and we started to see yearly summaries here and there about how much post in Facebook are or how much tweets were made, etcetera.
At Xmartlabs we were working for a while in data analysis but we have never shared anything yet, our plan was to work on something we find interesting and share it to the world to see if you find it interesting too.

As you may know one of our passions is the Open Source, we try to share as much as we can (and we will keep doing it).
We have been working on many open source tools that helps developers to improve development speed and providing tested, cleaner & extensible code that is used by many people in the whole world.
We use GitHub to share this passion and since we love this tool, we thought it would be interesting to study the use of GitHub for open source projects.

We use this tool every day from Uruguay to collaborate, but from where are people from in general?
To what extent do people in the different places of the world collaborate?.
What are commit messages from open source projects like? Or even a simpler question: what were the most preferred repos of the year?

Secondly as scientists that we are we wanted to feel the power of first class tools such as Spark and Databricks.
So we started a process in which we came to grips with these technologies and found out some interesting things.

## The Stack Used

Before reaching the data insights, let's talk a little bit about where it came from and the tools we tried out. There is the [GitHub Archive], which records all the public activity on GitHub and can be accessed for free.
From its website you can grab historical data of the activity registered on GitHub since 2/12/2011.
It has an endpoint that lets you request the historical data files by hour, each of which has an average size of over 80MB when unzipped.
So for one year this is a lot of data provided you want to store it and process it yourself (700GB+)! This was a job for [Spark]!

Spark let us process data in a cluster of machines in a fast and efficient manner.
There are several ways to use it but we aimed at [Databricks] owing to the high level of abstraction it provides, by using web notebooks very similar to [Jupyter Notebook]'s and by exploiting Amazon EC2 instances with ease.
And it let's you load files from S3 out of the box, so we crafted a script called [gh2s3](https://github.com/xmartlabs/gh2s3) to transfer the GitHub Archive's 2016 data to S3.
As we also needed more data like the users' locations, we made use of [Scrapy](https://github.com/scrapy/scrapy), a Python library to build crawlers, to extract this data from GitHub's API.
Scrapy allows to throttle the request rate to stay inside GitHub's rate limits, among many other things.

<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px"><img src="/images/github-roundup/databricks.png" alt="Databricks Architecture" /></div>

There is also [Apache Zeppelin] which is an amazing open source alternative for doing this. Databricks is much more straightforward to use, letting you to start working immediately while Zeppelin requires a bit more configuration.
On the other hand, Zeppelin is more flexible and allowed us to embed JavaScript code more easily in the notebook, so we ended up using it instead.
We set it up to work on top of [Amazon EMR], with EC2 instances and with the same S3 data. But then we found that [the GitHub Archive is published on Google BigQuery](https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/public-data/github) as a public dataset, so paying for the processed bytes was smarter.

This was the simplest by far for this particular case. Epic win!

## Maps

We first decided to analyze the commits and see where they come from, mapping them to the location that the committers declare in their own profile.
This work was inspired by [a similar previous work by Ramiro GÃ³mez](http://geeksta.net/visualizations/github-commit-map/).
We used a [script that is based on his work with some minor modifications](https://github.com/xmartlabs/gh-commit-locations).
This script basically reads JSON files with the user information from GitHub, takes the users location string and tries to map it to a country.
As this location is just a string and can be anything (like 'Earth', 'localhost' or 'Milky Way' for example) it's not always mappable to a country.
The script tries to find the name of a country or city in the location string and can map this to a country in more than 96% of the cases where the location is not empty. This is a pretty impressive result.
In this case we plotted the commits from the users by country, then comparing them with population and area.
We also took a look at the amount of committers in addition to the commits. To plot the data into the map, we segmented it accordingly in 8 levels.

<select id="dropdownselect" onchange="selectedMapType();">
  <option value="commits">Commits</option>
  <option value="commitsPop">Commits per 100k inhabitants</option>
  <option value="commitsPopHdi">Commits per inhabitants and HDI</option>
  <option value="commitsArea">Commits per 1000 square km</option>
  <option value="devPerMil">Developers per Million inhabitants</option>
  <option value="commitsAndDevs">Commits per Developer</option>
</select>

<div id="container" style="width:100%;height:500px"></div>

### Commits

The first map shows the commits with respect to the countries.
It comes as no surprise that **US** is the largest source by far.
Is then followed by **Germany**, **China** and the **United Kingdom**.
It was expected to see highly developed countries among the top: countries from **Western Europe**, **Australia**, **New Zealand**, among others, as well as **India** and **Brazil**.
All these are the countries that most shake the open source world!
But what if we compare this data with the countries' population? China for instance has a clear advantage over the rest.

<div id="commits-table-wrapper"></div>

So there's a map that takes into account the inhabitants. Here **Switzerland**, **Netherlands**, **Sweden** and **Canada** stand out.
Still, it roughly shows the degree of development of the countries, so we added a another map to contrast it with the countries' HDI (Human Development Index) from [the last report](http://hdr.undp.org/sites/default/files/2015_human_development_report.pdf).
We got that countries such as **Greece**, **New Zealand** and **Finland** do very well! The big surprises are **Namibia**, **Costa Rica**, **Uruguay**, **Puerto Rico** and **Brazil**.
At Xmartlabs we are glad to contribute to this stats :D.

#### The Biggest Surprise of All: Cocos Islands

The country is located in the Indian Ocean and has a population of approximately 600 inhabitants, 14 km2, a HDI of 0.829 and 11,036 commits!

<div style="text-align:center;margin-bottom:20px"><img src="/images/github-roundup/cocos.gif" alt="WHAT!?" /></div>

Is it true? This and other outliers happen to be countries with little population, in which small amounts, very few data and the presence of errors in the users' stated locations can make them show up.
More known countries fall here such as **Monaco** and **Vatican City**.
For example, [Zeke](https://github.com/EZ3CHI3L) is a user who claims to be from the latter. Also take into account this countries use to have higher HDI. Moreover, Monaco has a HDI greater than 1!

### Committers

Up to now we have seen the amount of commits, but how many committers do we have with respect to the population?
By taking a look a the corresponding map we see some differences.
This time **Chile**, **Argentina**, **South Africa**, the **United Arab Emirates**, **Sri Lanka** and **Taiwan** fare better.
We also provide a map that compares the number of committers, with respect to the population.

#### Newcomers

Developers from African countries, such as **Guinea-Bissau**, **The Democratic Republic of the Congo**, **Botswana** and **Algeria**, seem to have a great number of commits.
They have 1, 5, 6 and 6 committers respectively, so they seem to be few but good!
Examples of them are: [ivandrofly](https://github.com/ivandrofly), [jniles](https://github.com/jniles), [tsetsiba](https://github.com/tsetsiba) and [assem-ch](https://github.com/assem-ch).

Oh, btw, there's also a map showing the commits per country area.

## Commit Messages Analysis

We also wanted to study the commit messages. For this we defined some metrics and compared the global values to those of some pretty much used repositories.

The metrics we took were the following:

* **Messages with 'fix'**: Messages that include the string `fix`. This commits should be a representation of bug fixing commits and not commits that change documentation or add a new feature.
* **Messages with link to an issue or pull request**: These are messages containing references to GitHub's issues or pull request like `#xxx`.
* **Messages shorter than 15 characters**: Following the good practices for commit messages posted on several sites like [OpenStack](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/GitCommitMessages#Information_in_commit_messages) we searched the commit message length to see how many are too short. It is not easy to specify a number of characters for which we say this is too short but in general commit messages should be descriptive of the solved problem or the new feature so that a message with less then 15 characters should not be a good message. We could also have tried a higher number than 15.
* **Average message length**: The average length of commit messages. To get an insight to how messages are structured for a repo in general.

We then chose some repositories with a lot of stars, from different programming languages and communities.
So we chose Linux as one of the biggest repos as well as Bootstrap and JSON-Server which share a language but are maintained quite differently.
We also compared this to the results of all the commit messages with some interesting results:

|                                               | Linux  | Bootstrap  |  JSON-Server |   Global    |
| --------------------------------------------- | ------ | ---------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| Total messages                                | 12,192 | 4,928      | 136          | 262,414,932 |
| Messages with 'fix'                           | 42%    | 17%        | 8%           | 10%         |
| Messages with link to issue or pull request   | 2%     | 37%        | 16%          | 8%          |
| Messages shorter than 15 characters           | <1%    | 5%         | 26%          | 17%         |
| Average message length                        | 664.7  | 82.4       | 37.5         | 60.3        |

The first thing that caught our eye was the high standards Linux keep for their commit messages as not even 1 in 100 is shorter than 15 characters and that the average length exceeds 664 characters.
This completely contrasts with the relatively high percentage of short commits in JSON-Server, but also in general.

Not surprising is the fact that almost half of the commits in Linux do `fix` something and that `fix` appears in those long and complete commit messages.
This makes sense with the fact that Linux receives more bug fixes than new features.

There is also a great difference between Bootstrap and Linux in terms of linking to issues and pull request as the Linux repo has issue reporting disabled on GitHub and does merge commits that do not always come from GitHub pull request but SCM.
If that was not the case then low amount of links to issues or pull requests would mean a lot of direct pushes to master branch (as pull request merges would be caught by this rule).

## Stars Analysis

This is the top 20 repos in stars received in 2016:

|                   Repo                    |  Stars  |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------- |
| FreeCodeCamp/FreeCodeCamp                 | 181,529 |
| jwasham/google-interview-university       |  30,252 |
| vuejs/vue                                 |  28,231 |
| tensorflow/tensorflow                     |  27,857 |
| vhf/free-programming-books                |  27,239 |
| facebook/react                            |  25,814 |
| getify/You-Dont-Know-JS                   |  24,517 |
| sindresorhus/awesome                      |  24,441 |
| chrislgarry/Apollo-11                     |  23,553 |
| yarnpkg/yarn                              |  21,202 |
| facebook/react-native                     |  19,787 |
| twbs/bootstrap                            |  19,232 |
| airbnb/javascript                         |  19,008 |
| joshbuchea/HEAD                           |  18,804 |
| firehol/netdata                           |  18,562 |
| facebookincubator/create-react-app        |  17,738 |
| robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh                    |  17,200 |
| FallibleInc/security-guide-for-developers	|  15,843 |
| open-guides/og-aws                        |  15,512 |
| github/gitignore                          |  15,137 |

We can see that **Free Code Camp** still gains lots of attraction! It currently has 216,340 stars, so most of them (86%!) were achieved this year.
I mean, that's an average of 577 stars per day! However this outlier can be explained taking into account that the number of people interested in programming increase in large quantities every year, that Free Code Camp is the mainstream entry point for it and that one of their first tasks asks for starring the repo.

It's interesting to see how certain repos that have been around for some time are still among the most attracted, like **Twitter Bootstrap**, **gitignore from GitHub** and **free-programming-books**.
But incredibly the second place is for **google-interview-university** that reached this position even though it's way younger that the others. As a result, one can wonder how well new repos perform.

### Top Rookies

This is the Top 20 in stars for the repos created in 2016:

|                      Repo                      | Stars  |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------ |
| jwasham/google-interview-university            | 30,252 |
| yarnpkg/yarn                                   | 21,202 |
| joshbuchea/HEAD                                | 18,804 |
| facebookincubator/create-react-app             | 17,738 |
| FallibleInc/security-guide-for-developers      | 15,843 |
| open-guides/og-aws                             | 15,512 |
| jgthms/bulma                                   | 12,141 |
| toddmotto/public-apis                          | 11,749 |
| tensorflow/models                              | 10,855 |
| songrotek/Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap | 8,640  |
| FormidableLabs/webpack-dashboard               | 8,124  |
| Blankj/AndroidUtilCode                         | 7,826  |
| dthree/cash                                    | 7,719  |
| gztchan/awesome-design                         | 7,681  |
| alexjc/neural-doodle                           | 7,470  |
| expressjs/express                              | 7,372  |
| FreeCodeCampChina/freecodecamp.cn              | 7,274  |
| NamPNQ/You-Dont-Need-Javascript                | 7,118  |
| huluoyang/freecodecamp.cn                      | 6,960  |
| angular/material2                              | 6,900  |

3 of them are in the Top 20 and the rest have a good amount of stars with respect to it.
There are several repos related to **JavaScript and Web Development**: yarn, create-react-app, bulma, public-apis, webpack-dashboard, cash, awesome-design, express, You-Dont-Need-Javascript and material2.
Also, a tendency seems to be mirrored here: **Deep Learning**, via TensorFlow models, Deep-Learning-Papers-Reading-Roadmap and neural-doodle.

So 2016 let amazing repos appear such as the new dependency manager **yarn**, **public-apis** that has a list of open JSON APIs for web development and **neural-doodle** that generates masterpiece art images from very simple doodles!

### Top Languages

Analyzing the Top Repos again, they roughly fall into one of the following categories: they are related to **JavaScript or Web Development**, they **come from a big tech company** or they are **general guides**.
Regarding the first category, we have: vue, react, You-Dont-Know-JS, yarn, react-native, boostrap, a JavaScript style guide from Airbnb, HEAD and create-react-app.
So, is JavaScript the most popular language? Take a look at this table, that shows the stars received with respect to the language involved in each repo:

| Language   | Sum of stars |
| ---------- | ------------ |
|	JavaScript | 186,219      |
|	Shell      | 121,161      |
| HTML       | 120,659      |
| CSS        | 115,067      |
| Python     | 104,823      |
| Ruby       |  66,218      |
| Java       |  61,409      |
| C          |  60,201      |
| Makefile   |  54,238      |
| C++        |  53,854	    |

Yeah, **Javascript** is by far the most popular, as it has also been shown by the [Stack Overflow Developer Surveys](https://stackoverflow.com/research/developer-survey-2016#technology).
They really have a large community. **HTML** and **CSS** are among the top too. Notably, Shell takes the second place.
And it makes sense to see **C**, **Makefile** and **C++** next to each other, as they are commonly used together.
The rest of the table is not surprising except for the absence of **Swift** and **Objective-C**.
There's a more complete pie chart here:

<div id="languages-pie-wrapper"></div>

### Stars timeline

For example, take a look at the stars timeline of **google-interview-university**:

<div id="stars-timeline-wrapper"></div>

The repos' star events tend to happen with big spikes, as they spread virally like rumors in social media.
The day it reached the apex was the same day that [it was shared on HackerNews](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=12649740) and from there [shared on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/cscareerquestions/comments/565ors/google_interview_university/).
And [according to the author](https://googleyasheck.com/my-github-project-is-trending/#backstory), it all started on October 4th when [Amit Agarwal shared it on Twitter](https://twitter.com/labnol/status/783203765113524224).

What we learn from this and from other cases?
There is nothing new under the sun: if you have something that's interesting for people in general or for a niche and you are able to make someone influential share it, you will surely get in the trending.
Chances are that your repo will stay among the top for some time because the GitHub trending repos are a showcase too :D

## Summary

2016 was a great year for GitHub. Even though **developed countries** are the ones that most contribute, there is a commitment with Open Source from all over the world, including **islands with very few population**!
And there are countries such as **Greece and Namibia** that exploit their potential at best.

Few **commits** seem to be **fixes** whereas in projects such as **The Linux Kernel** there are plenty of them.
Besides, **new projects** seem to be **less structured** but some of them take it to the other end, having **meaningless commit messages**.

New cool repos such as **yarn** appeared in 2016 as well as relics such as **Linux**, **Twitter Bootstrap** and the not-so-new **React** keep gaining attention. **JavaScript** still is the trending language.
