JAMstack is likely a top trends in web development nowadays. Everyone is talking about the modern web development architecture. In this blogpost I'm gonna cover what caused JAMSTack rapidly adoption, the JAMStack community and ecosystem and of course what JAMStack means.

## JAMStack, What does it means?

You may have already worked on a JAMstack site! First of all, it's worth clarifying that JAMStack has nothing to do with operating systems, specific web servers, backend programming languages, or databases. It's totally agnostic in terms of these concepts.

JAMStack is just a nomenclature and a kind of name to a modern web stack architecture and ecosystem which delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience compared with the well know monolithic web architecture.

Something that all JAMStack apps have in common is that they do not depend on a monolithic web server, they are serverless.

Let's see how people define JAMStack:

According [jamstack.org](https://jamstack.org/)

> Fast and secure sites and apps delivered by pre-rendering files and serving them directly from a CDN, removing the requirement to manage or run web servers.

> Pre-rendered sites can be enhanced with JavaScript and the growing capabilities of browsers and services available via APIs.

Mathias Biilmann, the CEO of Netlify, describes JAMstack as

> a modern web development architecture based on client-side JavaScript, reusable APIs, and prebuilt Markup.

> .. is fast emerging as the modern approach to building dynamic serverless applications.



**JAM**Stack stands for Javascript, APIs and Markup respectively.

**Javascript (J)** running on the browser handles any dynamic programming during the request/response
cycle. Could be any front-end framework  (e.g. Vue.js, React.js), js library or even raw javascript.

**APIs (A)** All server side actions are encapsulated into microservices, usually third party managed microservices. The Javascript code running on the browser consumes these reusable APIs services through HTTP calls and typically exchanges JSON format data (not HTML).

**Markup/Markdown (M)** Some template system engine is used to pre-build the entire static site at deploy time, usually using a SSG (static site generator) for content sites or a build tool for web apps (e.g. Gatsby.js). Also, Markdown is relatively easy markup language to learn and we can generate HTML content from it using a SSG.  

The main point behind JAMStack is leveraging the browser and JS capabilities by prebuilding as much content as possible so we can serve these content from the CDN, by doing that we are actually decoupling the front-end from the backend (here the several microservices). Instead of having a monolithic server rendering and serving the resources, this modern web architecture splits these functionalities into small microservices which are consumed from the main app running on a browser. This main app is statically served through CDN nodes. Static refers to how sites are built and served, not the level of interactivity.

## Why the JAMstack?

Because JAMstack delivers better performance, higher security, lower cost of scaling, and a better developer experience compared with the well know monolithic web architecture.

**Better Performance**  
When it comes to minimizing the time to first byte, nothing beats pre-built files served over a CDN.
The JAMstack is faster because the browser processes functionality that the back-end traditionally executed (e.g. rendering documents on the fly on a server).

**Higher Security**  
With server-side processes abstracted into microservice APIs and the lack of a monolithic server, surface areas for attacks are reduced. JAMSTACK also leverages the security domain expertise of specialist third-party services.

**Cheaper, Easier Scaling**  
There is no need for a managed monolithic server, devops or costly infraestructure to develop and maintain. When your deployment amounts to a stack of files that can be served anywhere, scaling is a matter of serving those files in more places. CDNs are perfect for this, static content can be placed on a CDN making it easier to dynamically scale.  

**Better Developer Experience**   

JAMStack also changes how developers work. They can focus on value-added features since they leverage microservices functionality.
JAMStack encourage a git centric workflow where developers create branches, pull requests and merge these changes into a production branch and a continuous delivery process automatically runs, pre-building the front-end static content and deploying the site to a CDN. So any changes in git will automatically be reflected and distributed to the CDN all over the world.
Developers just need to rely on the git versioning system since deployments are automatically performed saving a lot of time.

Additionally, using a Git repository allows the entire website to be centrally hosted so any developer can run the app locally since there is no need to set up servers, DB and so on.

## Monolithic web stack vs JAMStack

Web stack architecture and ecosystem has been evolving since it very beginning, let's compare the monolithic stack against the JAMStack.


<img src="/images/jamstack-intro/jamstack.jpeg" />


**Monolithic web stack**

The monolithic web architecture is the way we have been creating web app over the last decade and half where each document is created on the fly (a monolithic server receives a request, queries a db and combines the data from the page's markup generating a new HTML document) upon a http request (rails, express, Flask are some web frameworks which follows this approach). Here the browser communicates with a central server which communicates to a db layer. This approach has caused a lot of security issues since we create almost every document from scratch, it also suffers performance and scalability issues. Normally we end up adding many caching layers, db caching, memory caching and http caching and so on. We can say that the website needs to be build each time it's served.
LAMP and MEAN stacks are examples of this stack.


**Modern web stack**

In contrast to the monolithic web approach, there is no single origin of content, there is no single point of failure. We can also say that the loading time from any part of the world is pretty much the same since the front-end static code is distributed all over the world through the CDN.

<img src="/images/jamstack-intro/JAMStack-diagram.jpg" />

The git centric workflow allows us to host the entire website in its git repository and also allows us to pre-build and deploy the front-end static code whenever something is merged into the production branch.
As the diagram shows, the app relies on several microservices to perform server-side functionalities like sending emails, performing a payment flow and so on. Microservices typically solve a specific problem and are highly composable.

## What caused JAMStack rapidly adoption

In the last years, front-end development has turned out drastically. Modern browsers, static site generators (SSG), expansive Content Delivery Networks, and the API microservices economy caused the JAMstack’s emergence.

### Git growth

Git started to be more popular not only for version control but also it started to become the way developers collaborate, communicate and publish apps. At the same time FTP lost adoptions as fast as git gained.

### Browser capabilities & Front-end build tools

Browsers become really powerful, nowadays a browser is a lot more than a document viewer, it's also a JS application runtime. Also the front-end build tools and ecosystem rapidly evolving and are mostly open-source. All these tools completely changed the development workflow of the front-end developers. Building and compiling staff are becoming an essential part of the modern web development workflow.

### Microservices economy emerging

And finally, API microservices become more popular, there are specific services to anything and web developers started to rely on and combine these microservices instead of building and managing complex software systems. For small and medium-sized systems, they can deliver cost reduction, quality improvement, agility, and decreased time to market. Typically microservices are implemented by a third party company but it can be developed in house too.

## JAMStack Best Practises

As we have seen, this new web architecture stack is possible thanks to the web developer tools evolution, static site generators, microservices economy emerge among others.


When building JAMstack websites, we can really get the most out of the stack if we stick to the following best practices.

**Use CDN to serve your files**  
Because Jamstack projects don’t need to rely on server-side code, they can be distributed instead of living on a single server. Serving directly from a CDN unlocks speeds and performance that can’t be beat. The more of your app you can push to the edge, the better the user experience.

**Modern Build tools**  
Ideally, we should take advantage of modern build tools. By using tools like Babel, PostCSS, Webpack, Gulp/Grunt we are able to use web standards still not supported in the market browsers, we can follow good practices optimizing assets and automating repetitive and time-consuming tasks.

**Everything lives in git**  
Git is fundamental to the JAMstack because it holds all the site’s components, the entire site should be pushed to a git repository. There are publishing platforms that offers CI & CD and app distribution to CDNs services so the site is automatically pre-build and deploy whenever a git remote branch changes. This workflow embodies the modern software development life cycle practice of Continuous Integration and Deployment (CI/CD).
Having the entire site code centralized in git reduces the contribution friction since anyone is able to clone it and execute a command (e.g. npm install) to set up dependencies and run the website locally. There is no databases to clone, no complex installs, this extremely simplifies staging and testing workflows.

**Automated builds**  

Because JAMStack markup is prebuilt, content changes won’t go live until you run another build. Automating this process will save you lots of frustration. You can do this yourself with webhooks, or use a publishing platform that includes the service automatically.

**Atomic deploys** Any CDN content update must be performed at the same time despite the a app size and the amount of files involved. No changes should go live until all changed files have been updated otherwise can cause inconsistent state while the update process completes.

**Instant cache invalidation**  
Cache Control values in each file must be property set up to avoid inconsistent outdated files after deploying a new version to the CDN.


## JAMStack ecosystem

At this point you should have enough information on JAMStack to define if it would be useful to your app or not. Now, I would like to share some community tools and useful microservices available to leverage in your app. An important part when creating a JAMStack site is the microservices selection which mostly depend on the app functionality.

[Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) It's a publishing platform for JAMStack apps. It offers CI & CD and app distribution to CDN.


[staticgen.com](https://www.staticgen.com) lists all SSG alternatives including the frameworks to build a static site with react or vue.js web frameworks.  
[Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Eleventry](https://www.11ty.dev/) seems to me the most interesting SSG. Hugo because is super fast pre-building the entire website markup and Eleventy because is easy to use and flexible in terms of template system language.

[nextjs](https://nextjs.org/) and [gatsbyjs](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) are popular static site generators for react.js.  
[nuxtjs](https://nuxtjs.org/) and [gridsome](https://gridsome.org/) allows us to generate a static site using vue.js.

In many cases a JAMStack site needs to run  code, there are microservices that allows us to do so without provisioning or managing servers.
[AWS Lambda](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda/) is a very popular one. Netlify has Functions which allows to deploy serverless AWS Lambda functions on Netlify just by adding a file to your Git repository.
[Google serverless computing solutions](https://cloud.google.com/serverless-options) and [Microsoft serverless computing solutions](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/overview/serverless-computing/) are others serverless compute services out there.

There are also many microservices providing content management system solutions (CMS), each one with its pros and cons. [sanity.io](https://www.sanity.io/), [storyblok](https://www.storyblok.com/), [prismic.io](https://prismic.io/), [contentful](https://www.contentful.com/), [ghost](https://ghost.org/), [netlifycms](https://www.netlifycms.org/) are some of them.

In terms of DB solutions, there are also a big list of them. [faunaDB](https://fauna.com/), [firebase](https://firebase.com/), [Amazon DynamoDB](https://aws.amazon.com/dynamodb/), [Azure Cosmos DB](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cosmos-db/), [Amazon Aurora Serverless](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/aurora/serverless/), [Amazon Relational Database Service](https://aws.amazon.com/rds/), [Cloud SQL](https://cloud.google.com/sql/docs/) are some alternatives.

Services like [Auth0](https://auth0.com/), [Okta](https://www.okta.com/), and [Netlify Identity](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/identity/) offer a cloud-based identity management service.

The microservices listed above are not intended to be exhaustive in any means, it's just to give an idea of how mature is the microservices industry.  

## Final thoughts

As we have seen the front-end tooling, static site generators and microservices ecosystem are mature enough and the JAMStack is a reality.
Benefits of adopting a JAMStack architecture are clear, maybe the most interesting question is: Can JAMStack be adopted by any site?
Time, usage and community evolution will give us the answers but API microservices emergence and front-end development tooling will continue getting better and better. Maybe if your app needs something from a very specific niche, you may have to implement it by yourself as a microservice but you are still able to follow a JAMStack architecture.

Let's see what JAMStack has to us in the years to come!!
