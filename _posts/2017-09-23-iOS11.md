Since September 19, iOS 11 is available to be upgraded in your devices. This means that some changes will going to surprise you.
This new released includes new features and technologies (don't be so anxious and wait to see all the details download ;) ).


## New features

- The first thing that you may notice when you upgraded your device, is the customize Control Center. Yay! Finally we can get this panel with the shortcuts that we already need. Here you can see that new options appear, like "Do not disturb While Driving", a shortcut to the Apple TV Remote, the flashlight with intensity and the screen recording are the more outstanding things.

All of this shortcuts can be added or removed in the Control Center settings.

- If you are the ones that has a 16GB iOS device, I will be sure that this new feature will blow your mind!
Apple identify the unused apps or data and gives you the option to "Offload" it.

What that means?
If you enable this option, when the storage space is running low the app will be removed from your iOS device. Whhhhaat?? Be calm, all your data and documents associated with the app will continue in your device. That leaves you some free megabytes or gigabytes at least and iOS will re-download the app the next time you open it.

- Now live photos has some new tricks that you will love to. If you have turned off this feature, we recommend you to turn it back on. Now this little clip can be edited to make it loop, bounce back or create a long exposure video.

- As we already mentioned a screen recording option has been added. This allow you to narrate with your screen without taking a lot of screenshots and drawing on it to explain something or just record a gaming session and then share it. Really cool, don't you?

- A new screenshot tool that allows you to edit it and draw on it, appears. The process to take a screenshot doesn't change, but once that you take a screenshot, it throws a little thumbnail down into the lower-lefthand corner and tapping on it the editor is open.

## Some cool stuff
- Now is possible read QR Codes just with the camera.
- Notification Center is no more, now all your alerts and notifications are now on the Lock Screen.
- Forget your Wi-Fi password. The next time a friend wants to connect to your Wi-Fi network, you can approve the request directly on your iOS 11 device without having to remember (this just works the first time that the device is connected to the network).
- Scan documents in the Notes app and add it.
- Go to the dark side... go to the dark mode to invert the colors.
- Siri now is able to translate a phrase for you.
- Now you can use one-handed keyboard in all your apps.


And the best for the end...
- Apple add a file manager app where you can access to your iCloud Drive files in both devices and include more others third-party cloud services in iPad. We know that Apple doesn't give us a completely control of our files, but this is a beginning.
You can copy, move, delete or share your selected items, create folder and also can drag and drop your files to another folder! This is new in Apple devices and we are very happy!
