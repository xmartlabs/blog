Building Android UIs with a consistent look and feel is easier than ever by using the new [Jetpack Compose] framework and setting up [themes](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose/themes).
Compose offers a Material theme implementation that makes it easy to use Material style throughout the whole app. 

As you may already know, Material allows us to have a consistent and uniform UI that follows Android UI best practices and guidelines, but at the same time, it's super rigid and limited when the app needs a more complex UI customization level.

In this post, we'll learn how to adapt, customize and extend Compose Material Theme in order to fulfill your app UI requirement and get rid of material limitations. 

# What's an application theme?
[Android Theme] is just a collection of resources that are useful throughout a given application.
Each resource has a semantic name such as `colorPrimary` that can be used as a reference from different places on the app.

Most Android apps already follow [Material Design Guidelines], that's the reason Jetpack Compose provides the `MaterialTheme` implementation for Compose apps.
It's a systematic way to customize Material Design to better reflect your productâ€™s design needs.
Material Theme comprises [color], [typography], and [shape] attributes.

### Sounds good, but is it perfect?
Material does a great job making sure every app follows Android UI guidelines, but it clearly lacks flexibility.
So, here lies the first problem: you have to adapt your look and feel to the Material guidelines, and if you don't, then it becomes hard to use it.

Secondly, Material comprises only [color], [typography], and [shape] attributes, but what if your app needs more resources, such as dimensions or icons?

# Extending Material Colors
Compose provides the [`Colors`] class to model the [Material color system] which includes nine colors and two functions to define light and dark color sets.

According to our experience, most apps need way more than 9 colors.
For example, a text link color or a subheader background color are common cases that signal the need for more colors.

An important comment here is that all of these colors should be defined in your color palette because they could change depending on the system's configuration (light or dark mode) or your app's state.

Suppose that we want to define a `subtitleTextColor`, in this case, Google recommends a way to do that:

```kotlin
@get:Composable
val Colors.subtitleTextColor: Color
    get() = if (isLight) Red300 else Red700
```

If you look closely at this code, you can see that the `subtitleTextColor` is only based on Material color's light property.
However, what if we wanted to handle multiple color palettes in the same app, how could we possibly achieve that?

The approach we will use is to define a brand new color class named `AppColor`, which will keep Material standard colors and add our own custom ones.

```kotlin
@Stable
data class AppColors(
    val subtitleTextColor: Color,
    val materialColors: Colors,
){
 val primary: Color
  get() = materialColors.primary
  // Add other material colors properties
}
```

`AppColors` then holds all of the app's colors.
Each application can also define multiple color palettes, often selecting one or another depending on the app's state.
Suppose that we now want to define two color palettes, one based on blue colors and the other based on pink ones:

```kotlin
enum class AppColorPalette {
  BLUE,
  PINK,
}

// AppCustomColors is private because we shouldn't expose a color that is not in a theme
private object AppCustomColors {
  val PINK_AMARANTH = Color(0xffe91e63)
  val PINK_MAROON = Color(0xffc2185b)
  val PINK_MAUVELOUS = Color(0xfff48fb0)
}

private val darkPinkColors = AppColors(
    linkTextColor = AppCustomColors.PINK_AMARANTH,
    materialColors = darkColors(
        primary = AppCustomColors.PINK_MAUVELOUS,
        primaryVariant = AppCustomColors.PINK_MAROON,
        .... // Material Colors
    )

// Define lightPinkColors, darkBlueColors, lightBlueColors the same way

@Composable
fun appColors(colorPalette: AppColorPalette, darkTheme: Boolean): AppColors =
    when (colorPalette) {
      AppColorPalette.BLUE -> if (darkTheme) darkBlueColors else lightBlueColors
      AppColorPalette.PINK -> if (darkTheme) darkPinkColors else lightPinkColors
    }
```

Note that, by using this approach, you may also define a colorblind-friendly palette, improving your app's accessibility.

Given a color palette and the UI mode, the `appColors` method returns an `AppColors` instance.
The complete implementation of these classes can be found [in Xmartlabs Gong template project code](https://github.com/xmartlabs/gong/blob/b0b617e/app/src/main/java/com/xmartlabs/gong/ui/theme/AppColors.kt).

Right now we have a method that provides an `AppColors` palette, but then how can we get the current app color palette?
Material provides a way of obtaining the current Material color palette, by invoking a `composable` method named `MaterialTheme.colors`.
To get our custom color palette, we will use the same idea: we will invoke `AppTheme.colors` and get it.
For that we will have to create our app theme, a custom theme that is the result of composing the `MaterialTheme`:

```kotlin
object AppTheme {
  val colors: AppColors
    @Composable
    @ReadOnlyComposable
    get() = LocalAppColors.current
}

private val LocalAppColors = staticCompositionLocalOf {
  defaultAppColors() // For instance, pink dark colors
}

@Composable
fun AppTheme(
    darkTheme: Boolean = isSystemInDarkTheme(),
    colorPalette: AppColorPalette = AppColorPalette.PINK,
    content: @Composable () -> Unit,
) {
  val colors = appColors(colorPalette = colorPalette, darkTheme = darkTheme)
  CompositionLocalProvider(
      LocalAppColors provides colors,
  ) {
    MaterialTheme(
        colors = colors.materialColors,
        content = content,
    )
  }
}
```

These lines define two things, a Composable app theme to handle our custom colors and a static class that provides them.
The full implementation of these classes can be found [here](https://github.com/xmartlabs/gong/blob/b0b617e56403c1f499704111acad89093aa3c9d6/app/src/main/java/com/xmartlabs/gong/ui/theme/AppTheme.kt#L10).

### Extending [shape] and [typography]

To extend these classes, we can follow the same idea.
We create an [`AppShapes`] class and an [`AppTypographies`] class the same way and declare custom theme properties.

I will not explain the code because it's , you can also find it on [Gong repo](https://github.com/xmartlabs/gong/tree/b0b617e/app/src/main/java/com/xmartlabs/gong/ui/theme) and if you have any questions, don't forget to comment!

# Adding custom resources to your theme

So far, we've learned how to extend the properties provided by Material, but what if our app requires new ones?
Remember, a theme is a semantic resource set, so we could also need dimensions, icons, or any other resource to build the custom app UI.

## Defining dimensions in our theme

Dimensions are something that we usually define in our theme since many of them have a meaning in our app context.
Examples are list items' padding, a "small size", and a container margin.

We can use a similar approach here and define a dimension class:


```kotlin
@Immutable
data class AppDims(
    val textSizeSmall: TextUnit,
    val textSizeMedium: TextUnit,
    val textSizeRegular: TextUnit,

    val listItemVerticalPadding: Dp,
    val listItemHorizontalPadding: Dp,
)
```

That's all fine, but you may be asking yourself a question which is: what are the actual advantages?
First, your theme will be consistent.
You can reuse the dimensions in multiple places throughout your app and thus make sure the correct values are enforced.
Second, you gain flexibility as you can define custom dimensions based on the device's state or specs.
A practical example, considering devices with small screens, is to define a separate set of dimensions for them to improve the user experience.
Last but not least, you avoid magic numbers making your codebase more maintainable and readable.

```kotlin
@Composable
fun appDims() = if (LocalConfiguration.current.screenWidthDp < 300) {
  smallDeviceAppDims
} else {
  regularAppDims
}

private val regularAppDims = AppDims(
    textSizeSmall = 12.sp,
    textSizeMedium = 14.sp,
    textSizeRegular = 16.sp,

    listItemVerticalPadding = 27.dp,
    listItemHorizontalPadding = 30.dp,
)

private val smallDeviceAppDims = AppDims(
    textSizeSmall = 12.sp,
    textSizeMedium = 13.sp,
    textSizeRegular = 14.sp,

    listItemVerticalPadding = 15.dp,
    listItemHorizontalPadding = 14.dp,
)
```

Then, you have to add the `AppDims` to your `AppTheme` just like we did with the `AppColors` example.

# Conclusion
UI/UX is one of the most important aspects of a mobile app.
Material has some guides to help improve it and also allows you to be consistent with other apps on the same platform.
Themes allow for consistency throughout an application, especially if you define it at the beginning, just by applying minor configurations.
However, we saw that Material themes lack flexibility, and if designers don't stick 100% to their guidelines, you may be in trouble as you will have to maintain many separate theme components not handled directly by your app theme.
In this post, we presented some ideas to avoid these issues, a way to extend the Material theme while making it flexible, and the most important aspect of all, how to adapt it to your product.
The code in this blog should be useful for most applications, but I recommend you check out [the full implementation on GitHub](https://github.com/xmartlabs/gong/tree/b0b617e/app/src/main/java/com/xmartlabs/gong/ui/theme), and adapt the general ideas to your specific use case.
