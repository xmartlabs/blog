  We are very happy to announce that Xmartlabs is <a href="http://rubyconfuruguay.org/#sponsors" target="_blank">Silver Sponsor</a> of the <a href="http://rubyconfuruguay.org/" target="_blank">RubyConf</a> Uruguay, which will take place at Torre de las
  Telecomunicaciones auditorium in Montevideo, on March 22-23.
</p>
<p>Maximo and Martin will be also giving a talk on mobile development, here's a little intro to it:
</p>
<p>"In mobile development, choosing between native, web, and hybrid apps is a harsh task, as it depends heavily on the app's requirements.
In this talk we will go over the key issues you should take into account when making this decision, so that you can take the best approach when building a mobile app."
</p>
<p>See you there!</p>
