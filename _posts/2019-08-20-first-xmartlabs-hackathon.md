Last Saturday Xmartlabs held its very first hackathon!
For those who are not familiar with the concept, a hackathon is an event where everyone who is involved in software development -be it graphic designers, project managers, software developers, etc- come together to collaborate in projects of different nature.
This means that projects don't necessarily have to be software-related, but can be anything the team sets their mind to.
Our hackathon had teams comprised of up to 6 members, and a whole day duration.

## Projects

In this case, all of the hackaton's projects were software-related (it runs through our veins, I guess).

### IoT

The first project was an IoT project. The team wanted to be able to ask, through a Slack command, if a specific bathroom in our office was occupied or not.

<br />

For this the team paired a ultrasonic sensor with an ESP8266 chip (essentially an Arduino Uno with WiFi capabilities) and also developed a custom command for Slack to give orders to the chip.
Although no one in this specific team had extensive experience working with IoT components, the project was functional in the end.

### Skillset blog

The second project was to build a Skillset blog of our team members, for internal use.

<br />

The challenge here were two: get specific information about all of Xmartlabs' collaborators skillset (we are around 50 now, so it isn't an easy task) and build the blog using state-of-the-art technologies like GraphQL and Nest.

### Endless Runner game

Another project was about creating a endless runner game using Unity and our very own assets.

<br />

Although currently it's only working for desktop PC's, the team is already planning on making a port for Android or iOS.

### Internal Rails app

The last project was another internal one.
The team built a Rails app -CMS, backend and frontend- with goodies like Google sign-in only for Xmartlabs' email accounts and a very nice UX/UI overall.

<br />

This app is actually going to save Xmartlabs around \$750 a year, as we now won't have to use a paid option.

## Barbecue

To celebrate a very fun and productive day, we had a traditional uruguayan BBQ.

We also welcomed Florencia and Valentina to our team:

All in all, it was a very positive experience and one that we for sure are going to repeat soon!
